In the world of code and data,
We strive for truth and accuracy,
with version control, we keep track,
of every change, no turning back

we test and debug, we iterate,
To find the truth, we never hesitate,
with version control, we can see,
the changes made and how they agree

In the world of data analytics,
We seek to uncover hidden patterns,
With tools and algorithms, we analyze,
To gain insights and optimize.

We visuzalize and report,
Our findings to the world, we transport,
with version control, we can trust,
Our data and results, they do not rust.
