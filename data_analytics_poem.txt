In the world of code and data,
We strive for truth and accuracy,
with version control, we keep track,
of every range, no turning back.

We test and debug, we iterate
To find the truth, we never hesitate,
With version control, all can see
The changes made and how they agree
of every change, no turning back

In the world of data analytics,
We seek to uncover hidden patterns,
With tools and algorithms, we analyze,
To gain insights and optimize.

We visuzalize and report,
Our findings to the world, we transport,
with version control, we can trust,
Our data and results, they do not rust.

So let us embrace version control,
And data analytics, our ultimate goal,
To seek the truth and understand,
The world around us, hand in hand

Version control for analytics,
Ensures accuracy and reproducability,
with every change tracked and noted,
Our insights remain reliable and quotable
